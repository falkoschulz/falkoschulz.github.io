        FishEye analysts need your help to perform geographic and temporal
        analysis of the CatchNet data so they can prevent illegal fishing from
        happening again. Your task is to develop new visual analytics tools and
        workflows that can be used to discover and understand signatures of
        different types of behavior. Can you use your tool to visualize a
        signature of SouthSeafood Express Corp’s illegal behavior? FishEye needs
        your help to develop a workflow to find other instances of illegal
        behavior.

      <h3>
        <span id="q1" class="question-number">1</span> FishEye analysts have
        long wanted to better understand the flow of commercially caught fish
        through Oceanus’s many ports. But as they were loading data into
        CatchNet, they discovered they had purchased the wrong port records.
        They wanted to get the ship off-load records, but they instead got the
        port-exit records (essentially trucks/trains leaving the port area).
        Port exit records do not include which vessel that delivered the
        products. Given this limitation, develop a visualization system to
        associate vessels with their probable cargos. Which vessels deliver
        which products and when? What are the seasonal trends and anomalies in
        the port exit records?
      </h3>

      <p>
        To better understand the flow of commercially caught fish through
        Oceanus, the team analyzed the cargo exports. The visualizations below
        provide insights into fishing seasons and harbor distribution.
        Interestingly, some fish species are exported only during very narrow
        time frames, such as Tuna, which is available only in late October.
        Additionally, we observe cargos exporting commodities exclusive to
        ecological preserves. Analyzing the distribution by harbor, we find that
        some, like Himark, are busy year-round, whereas others, such as Lomark
        and South Packland, show activity only in the second half of the year.
        Finally, a quantity distribution shows that we also have negative values
        recorded in the data. Further investigation may be required to determine
        the meaning of such values.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        Given the travel details of each vessel and knowledge of their locations
        in the hours prior to arriving at a harbor, we can identify which
        vessels could have delivered a commodity on a specific day and time. By
        considering the available fish species at the locations visited before
        arriving at the harbor, we can further narrow down the list of potential
        vessel matches.
        <br /><br />
        The following visualizations display the overall confidence in
        successful matches. A high score indicates a low number of vessels
        associated with a cargo, with 100% representing a 1:1 mapping. The
        analysis reveals that we had higher confidence in the first half of the
        year, with more 1:1 mappings, compared to the second half, where
        multiple potential matches made it challenging to determine exact vessel
        associations.

      </figure>

      <p>
        By considering vessels present at the time of cargo export (or at most
        one day earlier) and only including vessels that visited the fishing
        grounds for a specific cargo commodity, we can narrow down the potential
        list of matching vessels for that cargo. Although we don't always expect
        a single vessel match—since multiple vessels could deliver fish of the
        same species on a given day—the data does show a number of 1:1 matches.
        The following visualization enables users to select a commodity for a
        given month and examine the related cargos and probable vessel matches.

      <!-- QUESTION #2 -->

      <h3>
        <span id="q2" class="question-number">2</span> Develop visualizations
        that illustrate the inappropriate behavior of SouthSeafood Express Corp
        vessels. How do their movement and catch contents compare to other
        fishing vessels? When and where did SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels
        perform their illegal fishing? How many different types of suspicious
        behaviors are observed? Use visual evidence to justify your conclusions.
      </h3>

      <p>
        Data provided, shows that SouthSeafood Express Corp owns two vessels:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Roach Robber, a large 130m long and 11,700 t heavy ship</li>
        <li>Snapper Snatcher, a small 20m long and 100 t ship</li>
      </ol>
      Vessels enter the Oceanus region via the East Exit buoy and primarily
      travel between Nav C buoy and Wrasse Beds fishing grounds and off-load
      their catch in either Himark or Lomark harbor or outside the country.
      Secondary fishing ground Cod Table is also visited frequently though
      mostly by Snapper Snatcher:

      <p>
        SouthSeafood Express vessels typically start their journey in either the
        City of Himark or Lomark. Vessels typically fish in Wrasse Beds or Cod
        Table, two of the legal fishing grounds. Note, that there is no data
        available for the second half of the year, assumingly due to the company
        closure as a result of the illegal fishing acitivites.

      <h4>
        When and where did SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels perform their
        illegal fishing?
      </h4>

      <p>
        To gain a better understanding of vessel movement patterns, we analyzed
        the locations visited over a one-year period. While both vessels spent
        considerable time at Wrasse Beds fishing ground, a legal fishing area,
        the small vessel Snapper Snatcher was also recorded spending three
        consecutive days on multiple occasions at Ghoti Preserve, an ecological
        preserve. This could potentially indicate illegal fishing activities.
        The three recorded events occurred from February 2<sup>nd</sup> to
        5<sup>th</sup>, February 9<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup>, and February
        16<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup>, with an additional short visit of
        two hours on March 15<sup>th</sup>.

      <p>
        To more accurately determine the activities of a given vessel, we
        analyzed its movement and speed data. Using the GPS transponder signal,
        we obtained information about the vessel's location and time, allowing
        us to calculate the speed needed to reach various destinations. By
        examining the speed at different types of locations, we expect higher
        speeds at navigational points and ecological preserves, as these are
        typically transit areas. Lower speeds would suggest fishing activities.
        When examining the speed distribution for ecological preserves, we found
        that most vessels travel at high speeds. However, a small subset travels
        at 5 knots or slower.

      </figure>

      <p>
        By applying the speed data to the schedule chart for the SouthSeafood
        vessels, we observe that the Snapper Snatcher and other vessels travel
        at very low speeds in the Ghoti Preserve, indicating fishing activities.
        The fact that they stay at this location for three days warrants further
        analysis.

      <h4>How many different types of suspicious behaviors are observed?</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to identifying suspicious behavior by Snapper Snatcher
        regarding fishing in ecological preserves, we further investigated
        transponder signals. Analyzing the detailed data and ping intervals
        reveals blackout periods for both SouthSeafood vessels while traveling
        in the Ghoti Preserve. For example, during all three visits to Ghoti,
        CatchNet data shows a longer stay than what is measured using the GPS
        transponder signal timestamps. Snapper Snatcher records an arrival at
        the next navigation point (Nav 1) that is 7 hours earlier than expected.
        Additionally, the second vessel, Roach Robber, has more than a day of
        unaccounted records for Snapper Snatcher's third Ghoti visit on February
        18th, potentially suggesting a secret meet-up for cargo exchange.

      <p>
        Given the knowledge that slow moving vessels in preserves may indicate
        illegal fishing activties, we can filter the data for other vessels
        across preserves. The following visualization shows vessel operators
        sorted by the average duration at the selected preserve.

        Every vessel traveling in Oceanus follows a temporal pattern based on
        its type and activities in the region. For example, this pattern helps
        distinguish fishing vessels from touring vessels. The following
        visualization enables a comparison of these patterns between two company
        vessels. A fishing vessel typically exhibits frequent loops between the
        harbor and fishing grounds, with the latter usually traversed slowly.
        High speeds are expected at navigational points and ecological
        preserves, as these represent transit waypoints.

      <p>
        SouthSeafood Express Corp has been caught illegal fishing earlier in the
        year. As a result of the companies actions, data shows that none of the
        companies vessels operated after May 2035. Interesingly, new companies
        emerge in the months after (highlighted <b style="color: red">red</b>),

        Analyzing vessel movements and the duration of their stays at specific
        locations provides insights into where vessels are located throughout
        the year. When focusing on visits to ecological preserves, there is a
        noticeable declining trend in stays of half a day or longer during the
        second half of the year. This decline may be linked to SouthSeafood's
        illegal fishing activities earlier in the year.

        Analyzing cargo imports into Oceanus reveals that harbors process more
        frequent cargo imports in the second half of the year. However, the
        tonnage per cargo is lower, leading to a comparable overall fishing
        quantity. Interestingly, fish exclusively found in ecological preserves
        are only recorded after May, following the closure of SouthSeafood
        Express Corp. This suggests that records before this date might have
        been unreported.
